- Primary Action Button labeled “Next” to proceed to Builder step
- Secondary Action Button labeled “Save Draft” for intermediate saving
- Breadcrumb navigation reflecting progression and allowing step revisits
- Contextual help icon/tooltips providing brief explanations for metadata options
- Status indicator showing form validation state and completion readiness
 
Visual Style:
- Theme: Light mode
- Primary color: Teal (#008080)
- Supporting colors: Dark Blue (#003366), Soft Gray (#F5F7FA), Accent Orange (#FF6F3C)
- Spacing: Generous white space with consistent 24px vertical rhythm and 16px horizontal padding inside containers
- Borders: Subtle 1px solid borders (#D1D9E6) with 8px border radius on input fields and buttons
- Typography: Use a clean sans-serif font such as "Inter" or "Roboto" with a hierarchy of 16px body text, 20px section headings in semi-bold, and 14px for labels and help text in medium weight
 
The Enhanced AI Configuration Screen:
 
Smart Rephrase Component: Add a "✨ Smart Rephrase" button next to the prompt input field. Design a "Split-View" comparison modal that appears after clicking, showing "Original" vs. "Professionalized" text with "Use This," "Revert," and "Edit" actions.
 
Dynamic Parameter Toggles: Update the "Number of Questions" and "Number of Pages" counters to include an "AI Suggested" badge when the system auto-scales based on prompt depth.
 
Workflow Toggle: A card or toggle for "Review survey plan before generation (Yes/No)".
 
The New "Survey Blueprint" Review Screen:
 
This screen appears after "Generate Questions" but before entering the full Builder.
 
Visual Structure: A vertical "Structure Map" showing Section Titles, Page Breaks, and Question Types (e.g., "Page 1: 5 Questions - Star Rating, Multiple Choice").
 
Iteration Footer: Include an "Approve & Generate" button and a "Provide Feedback to Re-Plan" button. Add a small counter: "Plan Attempt 1/3".
 
 
Versioning & History Sidebar:
 
Design a collapsible right-hand sidebar titled "Survey History".
 
Timeline View: A list of versions (V1, V2, V3) with timestamps and summary tags (e.g., "V3: Active," "V2: Restored from Plan").
 
Action: A "Restore Version" button for any non-active state.
 
Visual Style Goal: Ensure the Arabic/English bilingual support is reflected in the UI layout. Use subtle animations (like a shimmer or a pulse) during the "Validate & Fix" processing state to show the AI is working internally.
